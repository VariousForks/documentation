### <i class="profeature">pro</i>Generating persistent thumbnails<sup style="color: gray">&nbsp;BETA</sup> {#thumbnailsGeneration}

In perspectives supporting showing of file previews like [Grid](https://www.tagspaces.org/extensions/perspectiveGrid) and [ImageSwiper](https://www.tagspaces.org/extensions/perspectiveImageSwiper), TagSpaces PRO is generating thumbnails for the visible files in the perspective. Currently the application tries to generated thumbnails for the following files types:

  * Images: PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, SVG, WEBP
  * Videos: WEBM, OGV, MP4, M4V
  * Notes: HTML
  * Audios formats: MP3 (with embedded thumbnail)
  * Ebooks: EPUB (with integrated cover image)
  * Archives: ZIP (it just takes an image found in the archive)
  * Office Documents: PDF, ODT, ODP, ODS, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX

In comparison to the community edition which generates thumbnails (only for PNGs and JPGs) on every opening of a folder, the PRO version persists the generated thumbnails in the `.ts` folder located in every folder you browse with it. This feature significantly accelerates the browsing of folders containing many files. The thumbnail generation can be activated in the PRO tab of the application settings.

Here is a short video showing the thumbnail generation in action.

#### Configure the thumbnails size and format
We have added the ability to configure the size and the file type of the create thumbnails. Now you can choose between `PNG` and `JPG` file types. For the thumb size you can choose between several sizes from `100` to `1000` pixel, limiting the height or width of the thumbs depending on which one is bigger.

> **Note:** For compatibility and performance reasons, when you change the thumbnail image type to `JPG`, the thumb is still saved with `PNG` extension.

Technically TagSpaces PRO created a sidecar file called `tsm.json` in the hidden `.ts` folder of every folder. This file contains the folder tags and  description.
