# View your files

## File previewing

The application supports previewing of many file types without the need of external viewer. It comes with the following viewer extensions:

* [Audio Video Player](extensions/viewerAudioVideo.html)
<!-- * [EPUB Reader](extensions/viewerEPUB.html)-->
* [HTML Reader](extensions/viewerHTML.html)
* [Image Viewer](extensions/viewerImage.html)
* [Link Opener](extensions/viewerURL.html)
* [Markdown Reader](extensions/viewerMD.html)
* [MHTML Reader](extensions/viewerMHTML.html)
<!--* [ODF Viewer](extensions/editorODF.html)-->
* [PDF Viewer](extensions/viewerPDF.html)
* [Text Reader](extensions/viewerText.html)
* [Simple Viewer](extensions/viewerBrowser.html)
* [ZIP Opener](extensions/viewerZIP.html)

TagSpaces is designed with extensibility in mind so any other kind of file viewers can developed and integrated easily.

## Source code browser and editor (use case?)
The text editor supports source code highlighting for many common programming languages. This in combination with the build in [JSON editor](/extensions/editorJSON.html) makes the application a good source code navigator with basic editing capabilities. The intention here is not to makes TagSpaces your next IDE, but rather to give your quick overview of source code repositories.
