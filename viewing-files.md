# File preview and print

## File preview

The application supports previewing of many file types without the need of external viewer. It comes with the following viewer extensions:

* [Audio Video Player](extensions/viewerAudioVideo.html)
<!-- * [EPUB Reader](extensions/viewerEPUB.html)-->
* [HTML Reader](extensions/viewerHTML.html)
* [Image Viewer](extensions/viewerImage.html)
* [Link Opener](extensions/viewerURL.html)
* [Markdown Reader](extensions/viewerMD.html)
* [MHTML Reader](extensions/viewerMHTML.html)
<!--* [ODF Viewer](extensions/editorODF.html)-->
* [PDF Viewer](extensions/viewerPDF.html)
* [Text Reader](extensions/viewerText.html)
* [Simple Viewer](extensions/viewerBrowser.html)
* [ZIP Opener](extensions/viewerZIP.html)

TagSpaces is designed with extensibility in mind so any other kind of file viewers can be easily developed and integrated.

> **Source code browser and editor** The text editor supports source code highlighting for many common programming languages. This in combination with the build in [JSON editor](/extensions/editorJSON.html) makes the application a good source code navigator with basic editing capabilities. The intention here is not to makes TagSpaces your next IDE, but rather to give your quick overview of source code repositories.

### Assigning file viewer to file extensions

<!-- ## Floating Action Button

At let lower right corner of the interface, you will find a **Floating Action Button** (or FAB), first introduced in Google's material design specification. The FAB you find TagSpaces slightly differs from he original material idea, inasmuch as it does not only allow a single action to be performed, but rather houses an overflow menu, which opens a contextually aware dialog. What the dialog offers depends on what is currently open, or what view the focus is on. The various menu options of the FAB overflow menu will be discussed in more detail, where relevant.

## Printing files
The majority of the viewer extensions has tha ability to print the opened files, thanks to the build in print functionality. In the following short video, you can see how you can start the printing.
