# Bookmark management
TagSpaces comes with a build-in viewer for `.url`, `.website` and `.desktop` files.
This is basically enabling you to use TagSpaces as a bookmark manager.
`.url` files can be created for example in Windows by dragging and dropping over the desktop a website from your browser.
`.desktop` files are the alternative to the `.url` files in Ubuntu.

Alternatively you can use the [TagSpaces browser extensions](webclipping.md) for Chrome and Firefox to create bookmarks in the supported format. In addition to saving the url and the data when the bookmark is created, both browser extensions are taking a screenshot of the current visible part of the web page. This screenshot is used later for creating the thumbnail of the bookmark in TagSpaces.

Once you open a bookmark in TagSpaces, a button with an URL will be shown in the viewer, allowing you to open this URL in your default browser, as shown in the following video.
