# Browsing Files and Folders in Perspectives

When you navigate to a folder in your active location, the files contained in the selected folder will be displayed on the main file browsing area of the user interface. TagSpaces offers flexible views to display your files. We call these views **perspectives**.

## Perspectives overview

Perspectives are not an integral part of TagSpaces, but exist as modular extensions. This modular approach allows for more flexibility, easier development, and customizability of each separate perspective. TagSpaces is delivered by default with one perspective. Other perspective can be added on demand in the Enterprise version of the product. In this document we will describe the following perspectives:

* [Default Perspective](/perspectives/grid.md) - presenting your files as list and in grid, suitable for tagging and file management.

* <i class="profeature">pro</i>[Gallery Perspective](/perspectives/gallery.md) - optimized for browsing and viewing images and photos. This extension is available in the Pro and Enterprise packages

* <i class="profeature">pro</i>[Mapique Perspective](/perspectives/mapique.md) - showing geo-tagged files and folder and folders on a map. This extension is available in the Pro and Enterprise packages

* [FolderViz Perspective (Discontinued)](/perspectives/folderviz.md) - this is an experimental perspective which applies some information visualization concepts to presenting your folder and file structures.

## Changing perspectives
Switching the perspective is task which can be easily done from the folder menu, which is accessible on clicking the button with the name of the current folder, as seen in the following screenshot.
