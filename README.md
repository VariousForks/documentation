# Introduction

This is the first draft of documentation for TagSpaces products as of **version 3**. Please note, that there are still many places where we show content and screenshot from the old version 2 of the app.

> **Warning:** This documentation is in <b>work in progress</b> status!

## About TagSpaces
TagSpaces is an open source, cross-platform, no backend, no login, personal data manager, and file navigator. It helps you organize your files, photos and other documents with tags on different platforms and/or devices, according to your own preferences and following your own logic, by using the same smart and friendly interface everywhere. The short introductory video below shows TagSpaces in action:

## About this document

>**Hint:** This documentation has currently a **WIP status**. The articles in this documents are being rapidly updated, with new information added regularly.

### The structure of this documentation

This documentation is built using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), for a streamlined and simple user experience. Each **page** will concern a particular topic, giving **detailed and illustrated explanations** and **instructions** about it. Every page is broken down to different level headings:

------

## Section titles

...will divide the chapters into smaller chunks

### Subsection titles

...will divide sections, while

#### Smaller headings

...might be included occasionally, for topics with specific significance

------

The navigation sidebar on the left side of this page will represent the **chapters** as expandable topics, with the **sections** listed in each expanded view.

### Illustrations
Much effort had gone into visually illustrating the documentation, so that you can instantly find what you are looking for, or what is being described in words. Most illustrations will feature some sort of annotation. For example if a **visible element** of the User Interface is discussed, a **neon-green rectangle around an element** will mark its location on the illustrating image.

When there are multiple elements discussed in the same paragraph, the illustrations will be further annotated with numbers, like on the image below while the corresponding numbers will be included in the text, after each element was first mentioned. For example the following image illustrates the structure of the navigation sidebar, with **major parts** (**1**) showing as unselectable titles, expandable **page titles** (**2**) will hold major **section titles** (**3**), both of which are clickable. Clicking page titles will open the corresponding page, while clicking section titles will open the page and scroll down to the start of the selected section.

>**Note to contributors:** When you annotate illustrations please use a rounded edge rectangle, with the following properties:
* **20 px radius** for the rounded corners
* **#1ccd9c color**
* **3-6px line width**, depending on image size (larger images can use thicker lines)
Additionally, please use a **28pt font size** for numbering with a basic **sans font**.

### Text markup

You will notice, that certain words are marked with **bold text**. These either mean names of elements, or significant notes/concepts about usage. *Italicized words* usually mark menu items, or other selectable elements, although it is not a hard and fast rule.

Bulleted lists will be used to
* Improve **readability**
* Make it **easier to find** what you are looking for.


### Document symbols

There are currently two types of symbols, apart from the usual text formatting and annotations, that you can find on these pages:

 * <i class="profeature">pro</i> - means that the described feature is part of the TagSpaces Pro and Enterprise editions.
 * ⚒ - means that the section is not ready yet and may contain unclear, or not up-to-date information, or sections might be missing entirely.
