# User Interface

<!-- toc -->

## Start screen

TagSpaces opens up as a single-window application that tries to make the best use of any space available, be it large wide screens, or small mobile displays. The user interface, devised along the guidelines of Google's material design specifications, is very adaptable. The application will look the same, regardless of the operating system, or platform it runs under.

This streamlined experience offers familiarity and an ease to use the application across platforms, while you will need to familiarize yourself with its extensive features only once. The following screen shows a typical start screen of TagSpaces with the list of the available locations on left, and content of the currently opened folder with the default perspective in center of the application.

The user interface of the application consists of the following main areas:

* [Location management](#location-manager) - located below the TagSpaces logo
* [Folder navigator](#folder-navigation) - located at the leftmost area of the user interface
* [Tag library area](#tag-library) - located at the leftmost area of the user interface (replaces the folder navigator, when active)
* [File browser area](browsing-files.html) - located in the main area of the user interface
* [File content area](viewing-files.html) - if a file is opened, the main area splits into two panes. The file viewer will occupy the right pane, while the left will be preserved for the file browser.

## Browsing Area
The file browsing area normally takes up he majority of the user interface. This is where all files from the currently active folder are displayed, either as a list, grid, or folder tree, depending on the active [**perspective**](browsing-files.html#Perspectives). To learn more about the all file browsing features, navigate to the [File Browsing Section](/browsing-files.html).
