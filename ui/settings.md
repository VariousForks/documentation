To access the settings dialogue, just click on the gears icon at the bottom of the left side panel

The dialogue has five tabs, which will be described in order:

## General

Most of the TagSpaces' common settings can be accessed from this tab.

![Setting - General Tab](/media/general-full.png)

* **Interface language (1)** - TagSpaces has been translated to a variety languages. Choose your preference here
* **Show files/directories with a dot(.) in front of the name (2)** - This will allow the browsing of hidden files in UNIX-like systems (Linux, OSX, BSD, etc.)
* **Check for new version on startup (3)** - You will be notified if a new version if available
* **Use default location as a startup location (4)** - TagSpaces will not remember your last active directory, but will always launch showing the specified location instead.
* **Enable colored file type extensions (5)** - Colour coded extension icons allow for easier navigation
* **Always show tag area on startup (6)** - Even if you close TagSpaces with the directory browser active, io the next startup the tag library will be shown.
* **Loads location meta data (7)** - reads meta from `tsm.json`, located in a .ts subfolder, if present
* **Limit files found to (8)** - This will limit the maximum amount of search results, possibly resulting in faster search
* **Search in sub-folders by default (9)** - With this enabled, any subfolders of the current location will be searched as well. When disabled, only the current directory will be included in the search
* **Export tag groups as json (10)** - Will create a JSON file with the current tag groups
* **Restore initial settings (11)** - Reset to defaults any time
* **Default tag background color (12)** - Allows you to change to default background of any newly created tags. Existing tags will not be affected.
* **Default tag text color (13)**- Allows you to change to default text colour of any newly created tags. Existing tags will not be affected.

The following feature are still considered **experimental**, change them at your own risk:

* **Watch current directory for changes (14)** - Will update directory data as and when files change
* **Tag delimiter (15)** - By default, TagSpaces used a `space` to mark tag boundaries (learn more [here](tagging.md)).  Here you can change this to another character.
* **Prefix for the tag container (16)** - By default, TagSpaces does not use a prefix to show that the next part of the filename contains tags (learn more [here](tagging.md)). here you can change that behaviour.

<!-- ## <i class="profeature">pro</i>Pro features {#pro-features}

The available options are:

* **Calculate tags from the current search results (1)** - Once activated, TS will extracting all the tags from the current folder and puts them in a separate tag group. (This option can considerably slow down folder navigation, when there are a lot of files and/or tags present.)
* **Move deleted files or folders to trash bin (2)** - will allow you to recover deleted files later
* **Enable the use of a hidden folder(.ts) for storing meta data and thumbnails** and  **Use sidecar files in the hidden folders for saving meta data (e.g. tags) (3)** - When used together, these two options will allow the users to store metadata like tags, separately from files themseÃ©lves. Useful, when filenames cannot be changed.
* **Enable thumbnails generation (4)** - will generate and store persistent thumbnails of image and file previews with the set parameters, allowing for faster navigation in any perspective that might use hem (e.g. **Grid Perspective**)

The following feature is still considered **experimental**, change it at your own risk:

* **Enable text extraction from files** will enable deep search functionality, to find keywords in file contents. This option can considerably slow down search performance!
