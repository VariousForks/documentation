# Installation and Setup

## Installing Windows version {#windows}
The Windows version of TagSpaces is distributed as `zip` file, which can be downloaded for [32bit](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-win32.zip) and for [64bit](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-win64.zip) versions of Windows, depending on your system. Then you have to just unzip the downloaded file in a folder of your choice somewhere on your system. In the unpacked folder you will find a file called `tagspaces.exe`, which can be executed with double click.

### Updating the Windows version
Just exchange the content of your current installation, with the content from the zip-file of a newer release. You don't have to worry about your tag library and locations since they are persisted in the users home folder.

## Installing OS X version {#osx}
For OSX 10.9 or later you have to download the [64bit](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-osx64.zip) of the application. Then you have to double click the downloaded zip file in Finder to unpack it properly. Some users are reporting issues with unpacking the app with some 3th-party zip utils.

> **Note**: By default Mac OSX does not allow TagSpaces to be executed with a simple double click, because it is currently not digitally signed. To work around this, right-click the TagSpaces.app folder and choose Open, then click **Open** on the dialog that appears. You need to do this just once.

### Updating the OS X version
Just exchange the content of your current installation, with the content from the zip-file of a newer release. You don't have to worry about your tag library and locations since they are persisted in the users home folder.

## Installing Linux version {#linux}
The Linux version of TagSpaces is distributed as `tar.gz` file, which can be downloaded for [32bit](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-linux32.tar.gz) and for [64bit](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-linux64.tar.gz) Linux versions, depending on your system. Then you have to just unpack the downloaded file in a folder of your choice somewhere on your system. In the unpacked folder you will find a file called `tagspaces`, which can be executed with double click or in a terminal. We also offer 64bit [deb](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-amd64.deb) and [rpm](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-amd64.rpm) packges for respectively Debian and Red Hat based distributions.

### Updating the Linux version
Just exchange the content of your current installation, with the content from the tar.gz-file of a newer release. You don't have to worry about your tag library and locations since they are persisted in the users home folder.

## Installing Android version {#android}
You can install the Android app directly from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tagspaces.androidle).

You can also find TagSpaces in the Mozilla's addon store, but consider that the version there could be some months old due to their slow approval process.

If you do not want to TagSpaces to check for the availability of new version, disable this functionality in the [settings](userinterface.html/#settings)

## Running TagSpaces in portable mode {#portable-mode}
The Windows and Linux versions of TagSpaces can be started in the so called portable mode, allowing the use of the application from an USB-stick or other portable devices. In this mode all the configuration information such as tags, tag groups and connection to locations is stored in a folder called *tsprofile*. This folder is located in the from where the application is started and not in the home user folder on current operating systems. The portable mode can be started with the `tagspacesp.cmd` script under Windows or the `tagspacesp` under Linux. These scripts are located in the unzipped application folder. Under Linux you have eventually to make this script executable with this command `chmod +x tagspacesp`.

### Updating the portable version
In order to update a version of TagSpaces used in portable mode for example on USB stick you have just to exchange the files and directories with the new ones, coming from the installation package of the new application version. As mentioned before in the portable mode, the tag library and locations are stored in the *tsprofile* folder. So to upgrade to a newer version of tagspaces, we have to take special care for this folder, please follow these steps for the upgrade:
 * Rename your existing *tagspaces* folder to e.g. *tagspaces_old*
 * Extract the downloaded tagspaces zip-file, this will create a new *tagspaces* folder.
 * Copy/move the *tsprofile* folder from the *tagspaces_old* folder to the newly created *tagspaces* folder.

> **Important**: So once again be careful not to delete the `tsprofile` sub folder, it contains valuable information for your portable TagSpaces instance.
